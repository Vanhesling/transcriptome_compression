Timeline/Tasks

To do: 
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- Trim text
- Expression optimization
- Actual expression calculations 



Misc:
- Expression optimization. 
- Get code in order
- Discussion points	- Number of reads required, increase in throughput and cost.

Our approach:	- Models RNA-Seq Data(*)	- Markers are expression optimized without sacrificing statistical power. (*)	- Robust (*)	- Looks at the expression of all pathways (*)	- Trained on the largest transcriptomic dataset known to date (*)	- Accurate (*)


Future directions:
- Application of Tradict to a large single-cell dataset.
