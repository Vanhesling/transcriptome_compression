#summary This is a short howto use Random Forest package

= Short Howto =

This is in no way replacing the tutorial files. This is just a quick start for the package.

There are two folders in the package and they have the source for Regression and Classification based Random Forests. Just add both to your path and you should be fine. And also everything was installed (like the compilation etc)

Lets say your data is in X_trn and labels/target values are in Y_trn. Make sure both of these are in doubles.

Simply Y_trn = double(Y_trn) and X_trn = double(X_trn) if you are not sure.


Creating Models
 regression: model_reg = regRF_train(X_trn,Y_trn);

 classification: model_class = classRF_train(X_trn,Y_trn);


Testing Models
We created model_reg and model_class in previous steps. Both are simply matlab variables that you can save, load, etc.



Testing/ Predicting for new data:
Let's say the data to predict is X_tst and Y_tst

regression: Y_hat = regRF_predict(X_tst,model);
            err_rate = (Y_hat-Y_tst)^2 %mse
classification: Y_hat = classRF_predict(X_tst,model);
            err_rate = length(find(Y_hat~=Y_tst)) %number of misclassification
