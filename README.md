Surojit Biswas, Konstantin Kerner, Paulo Jose Pereira Lima Teixeira, Jeffery L. Dangl, Vladimir Jojic, Philip A. Wigge. "Tradict enables high fidelity reconstruction of the euykaryotic transcriptome from 100 marker genes." Submitted (2016). BioRxiv: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/21/060111.

With the exception of data, this repository contains everything required to perform downloads from the SRA and recapitulate analyses performed in our paper. The repository is composed of several directories. Each is listed below with a brief description of its purpose and contents. Each directory has its own README that explains its contents in greater detail.

# Repository directories
1. **data_download** - Contains the custom scripts necessary to download and quantify raw RNA-Seq reads from NCBI's Short Read Archive (SRA).
2. **util** - Contains accessory code.
3. **analysis** -- Contains all code used to perform analysis and generate figures.
