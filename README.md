# Transcriptome compression

With the exception of data, this repository contains everything required to perform downloads from the SRA and recapitulate analyses performed in our paper. The repository is composed of several directories. Each is listed below with a brief description of its purpose and contents. Each directory has its own README that explains its contents in greater detail.

# Repository directories
